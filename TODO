# Complete the splitting of Pakset into (Pakset, Pak)

Move logic from save_object() and _object_defintion_line(), along with
Pakset::read_dat(), into:

   Pakset::read_dat() that only splits a .dat file into segments
   delimited by a line of at least three dashes '---'

   Pak::from_string() that takes one of those segments and puts all
   elements into its Pak object

Then complement with a new Pak::to_string

scan thru datfiles
locate keyword "source_image" or similar?
remap source image to destination image(s) given in front/back image...
also remap colors using factory mapcolor ... new "mapcolor2" ?

Can we compute mapcolor from goods specifications?
Where are the goods colors given?
Why does Passengers in 128.Britain have a mapcolor but no other goods do?

Shouldn't the raw materials (mines, farms) have a dark color of a
given hue, with the factories having intermediate lightness levels,
and consumers (stores) with the lightest tone of the given
hue+saturation ?




For that matter why is a symbol shown on the Minimap for Fishing
Grounds but not other industries? Where does that symbol come from?

# e.g., for an image with tilesize=128, to display the image at
# x=2,y=1 we would get: <img src="file://PATH" style="object-fit:
# none; object-position: -256px -128px; width: 128px; height: 128px">

# The above does not perform the "legacy light-cyan to transparent
# background" transformation Also file:// should be mapped to a Mojo
# or other web-server-mapped path to the file on this computer

Automatically creating menu buttons and cursors

Menu buttons are 32x32 (even in a 128x128 pak) and should be centered
and overlaid on a blank button.  In Pak128.Britain, menu_buttons.3.4
(and several others) are currently unused and blank with the proper
"shadow button" background.  The general case of how to find a
suitable blank button is not yet known.

A cursor icon should also be created.  Cursors should be centered in a
paksize grid and have the (0,0) image of the object, at about half the
size.

The little modifiers for passengers, mail, goods that stations accept
are located (in Pak128.Britain) in gui/gui64/symbols-64.dat with
Obj=symbol under name=(Passagiere, Post, Waren) [yes these are still
in German]

Icons for goods categories are in goods-category.dat with Obj=symbol
and name=GoodsCategories.  Image[0] is for special freight.

'to_string' method for Games::Simutrans::Pak

Concept: Read a datfile, parse some additional parameters (like
'paksize=128'); create a temporary .png using only the images used,
and adding some images (e.g., menu buttons and cursors from a set-wide
template); write to temporary dat file; call external makeobj program
to make the output binary .pak file

################

Additional Concepts for Games::Simutrans::Image â€”

- Combine multi-tile images into one, perhaps using location
  information from the .dat file

- Break images like TileCutter?
