# Returning source PNGs cropped for a single image

# e.g., for an image with tilesize=128, to display the image at x=2,y=1 we would get:
# <img src="file://PATH" style="object-fit: none; object-position: -256px -128px; width: 128px; height: 128px">
#
# The above does not perform the "legacy light-cyan to transparent background" transformation
# Also file:// should be mapped to a Mojo or other web-server-mapped path to the file on this computer
