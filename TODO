scan thru datfiles
locate keyword "source_image" or similar?
remap source image to destination image(s) given in front/back image...
also remap colors using factory mapcolor ... new "mapcolor2" ?

Can we compute mapcolor from goods specifications?
Where are the goods colors given?
Why does Passengers in 128.Britain have a mapcolor but no other goods do?

Shouldn't the raw materials (mines, farms) have a dark color of a given hue, with the factories having intermediate lightness levels, and consumers (stores) with the lightest tone of the given hue+saturation ?




For that matter why is a symbol shown on the Minimap for Fishing Grounds but not other industries? Where does that symbol come from?

# e.g., for an image with tilesize=128, to display the image at x=2,y=1 we would get:
# <img src="file://PATH" style="object-fit: none; object-position: -256px -128px; width: 128px; height: 128px">

# The above does not perform the "legacy light-cyan to transparent background" transformation
# Also file:// should be mapped to a Mojo or other web-server-mapped path to the file on this computer
