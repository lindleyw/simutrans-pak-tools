Pak::from_string -- (recursively) suppress trailing zero dimensions
when only one value at that level, except for first dimension.

# Combine multiple images into one?

scan thru datfiles
locate keyword "source_image" or similar?
remap source image to destination image(s) given in front/back image...
also remap colors using factory mapcolor ... new "mapcolor2" ?

Automatically creating menu buttons and cursors

Menu buttons are 32x32 (even in a 128x128 pak) and should be centered
and overlaid on a blank button.  In Pak128.Britain, menu_buttons.3.4
(and several others) are currently unused and blank with the proper
"shadow button" background.  The general case of how to find a
suitable blank button is not yet known.

A cursor icon should also be created.  Cursors should be centered in a
paksize grid and have the (0,0) image of the object, at about half the
size.

The little modifiers for passengers, mail, goods that stations accept
are located (in Pak128.Britain) in gui/gui64/symbols-64.dat with
Obj=symbol under name=(Passagiere, Post, Waren) [yes these are still
in German]

Icons for goods categories are in goods-category.dat with Obj=symbol
and name=GoodsCategories.  Image[0] is for special freight.

'to_string' method for Games::Simutrans::Pak

Concept: Read a datfile, parse some additional parameters (like
'paksize=128'); create a temporary .png using only the images used,
and adding some images (e.g., menu buttons and cursors from a set-wide
template); write to temporary dat file; call external makeobj program
to make the output binary .pak file

################

Combine multi-tile images into one, perhaps using location information
from the .dat file

################

Break images like TileCutter?  Perhaps even read TileCutter project files?

# Returning source PNGs cropped for a single image

################

# e.g., for an image with tilesize=128, to display the image at
# x=2,y=1 we would get: <img src="file://PATH" style="object-fit:
# none; object-position: -256px -128px; width: 128px; height: 128px">

# The above does not perform the "legacy light-cyan to transparent
# background" transformation Also file:// should be mapped to a Mojo
# or other web-server-mapped path to the file on this computer

# Goods colors
#
################

Where are the goods colors given?  In obj=good, mapcolor=.

Not all paks specify this (formerly, Passengers in 128.Britain had a
mapcolor but no other goods did)

Q: Shouldn't the raw materials (mines, farms) have a dark color of a
given hue, with the factories having intermediate lightness levels,
and consumers (stores) with the lightest tone of the given
hue+saturation ?

# Goods images on minimap
#
################

These are specified with e.g., gui/gui64/gui_extended_symbols.dat in 128 Britain as

    Obj=symbol

Q: Why is a symbol shown on the Minimap for Fishing Grounds but not
other industries? Where does that symbol come from?

A: Seems to be hard-coded as Obj=symbol, Name=IndustrySectors,
Image[0] value.  Then in gui/minimap.cc it checks if a 'fab' (factory)
get_sector is 'marine_resource' and displays exactly that icon.
